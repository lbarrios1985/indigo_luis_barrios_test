## Python Tech Challenge

The challenge is to create a program that computes some
basic statistics on a collection of small positive integers. You
can assume all values will be less than 1,000.

Implement this challenge in whatever programming language
best highlights your skills. Also, please supply a README with
details on how to setup and run your application.

## Requirements

The DataCapture object accepts numbers and returns an object for querying statistics about the inputs. Specifically, the returned object supports querying how many numbers in the collection are less than a value, greater than a value, or within a range. Hereâ€™s the program skeleton in Python to explain the structure:

capture = DataCapture()

capture.add(3)

capture.add(9)

capture.add(3)

capture.add(4)

capture.add(6)

stats = capture.build_stats()

stats.less(4) # should return 2 (only two values 3, 3 are less than 4)

stats.between(3, 6) # should return 4 (3, 3, 4 and 6 are between 3 and 6)

stats.greater(4) # should return 2 (6 and 9 are the only two values greater
than 4)

## Challenge conditions:

You cannot import a library that solves it instantly

The methods add(), less(), greater(), and between() should have constant time O(1)

The method build_stats() can be at most linear O(n)
